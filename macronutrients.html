        Macronutrients are the cornerstones of your diet. Learn more about where to get them, how much of them you need and what sources to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many eating plans focus on changing the amount of carbohydrate, fat or protein in your diet.</p>
      <p>
        That’s because manipulating how much of them you eat can have a big impact on your body.</p>
        <p>
        Carbohydrates, fat and protein are called macronutrients. They are the nutrients you use in the largest amounts.</p>
        <p>
        “Macronutrients are the nutritive components of food that the body needs for energy and to maintain the body’s structure and systems,” says MD Anderson Wellness Dietitian Lindsey Wohlford.
    </p>
    <p>
        No healthy diet should exclude or seriously restrict any macronutrient. Here is how much of each you should eat as part of a healthy diet, and the best sources.
      </p>
    
      <h2> Carbohydrates</h2>
      <p>
          Carbohydrates – or carbs – are the body’s primary fuel. They provide energy for your muscles and the central nervous system during movement and exercise. </p>

<p>Wohlford says 45-65% of calories per day should come from carbohydrates. The amount depends on an individual’s health goals and medical conditions.</p>
<h2> Protein</h2>
      <p>
        Protein is essential to many processes in the body. It provides structure to the tissue. That includes cell membranes, organs, muscle, hair, skin, nails, bones, tendons, ligaments and blood plasma. </p>

<p>The Recommended Dietary Allowance is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. For a person who weighs 150 pounds, that adds up to around 54 grams of protein per day.</p>
<p>
    Individual needs will vary depending on age, activity level, medical conditions and health goals.
</p>
<h2> Fat</h2>
      <p>
        Fat is vital for the body as an energy reserve, for insulation and protection of your organs, and for absorption and transport of fat-soluble vitamins.

 </p>

<p>About 20-35% of your total daily calories should come from fat, with less than 10% of total daily calories from saturated fat.150 pounds, that adds up to around 54 grams of protein per day.</p>
